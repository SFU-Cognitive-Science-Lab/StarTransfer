# StarTransfer

This repository contains data and analysis code for the manscipt titled: "Robustness of Performance During Domain Change in an Esport: A Study of Within-Expertise Transfer."

Each piece of code should be able to run on its own with little to no user input. The code listed here perform the following tasks

1. Sc1transferanalysis2022

	This code analyzes whether experience with StarCraft 1 is correlated in any way with early performance in StarCraft 2.

2. StarTransPlotting

	This code gathers the data from all analyses performed in this paper and creates graphs that are to be used in the final manuscript.

3. WolToHotsPredictionAnalysis

	This script creates a linear model based on a players performance in StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty and compares it to a linear model created using that player's performance in the later expansion, "StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm" and determines whether or not the Wings of Liberty model is able to reliably predict the starting point of the Heart of the Swarm model.

Data used in each analysis can be found in the accompanying "Data" folder. Review the Accompanying "Data Descriptions" file for a more detailed understanding of what each variable can be interpreted as.

Figures featured in the manuscript can also be found in their unprocessed form in the "Plots" folder
