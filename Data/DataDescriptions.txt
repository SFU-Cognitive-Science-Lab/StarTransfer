DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

---------------------



1. File List


   A.  BFLSurveyData.csv      

       Short description: This table contains survey repsonses made by players concerning how much experience they had with StarCraft 1, StarCraft 1: Brood War, or other real-time strategy games.

   B.  OnRaceOffRace_OutputTable.csv

   	Short description: Each row in this table represents averaged gameplay data from one game of StarCraft 2 for that player, with an emphasis on whether each game is played using the player's "dominant race" (most frequently played faction), or "Off race", meaning they are playing a faction they do not normally play as. 

   C.  wolVhos_OutputTable.csv

   	Short description: Each row in this table represents averaged gameplay data from one game of StarCraft 2 for that player, with columns representing whether this game was played using "StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty", or the later version fo the game "StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm".

2. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package:


	Several datasets exist representing middle steps between the raw replay files themselves and these usable datasets. They are not included here, but may be uploaded to osf in future as we remove all identifying information and ensure that ethical standards are met prior to publishment of the data.


3. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? No

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

---------------------------



1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

	Raw replay files are automatically generated by the StarCraft 2 game engine. Participants submitted these files to us through an online upload where they agreed to share their data with us, and then filled out a survey telling us about their experience with StarCraft and other demographic information.


2. Methods for processing the data: 

	A program called Sc2Gears was used to process the raw replay files into usable SQL tables, and these were further processed and filtered using Matlab and R to aggregate performance data into statistically relevant performance metrics.


3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 

	Requires at least R 3.5, run on R Studio

	Code used in analyzing the data and producing graphs is available for download here: https://github.com/SFU-Cognitive-Science-Lab/StarTransfer
	

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate:

	NA

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: 

	NA

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:

	Every piece of code written to aggregate this data received independent review and verification by 2 other lab members, ensuring that at least 3 people had worked to test every piece of code.

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: 

	Joseph Thompson
	Mark Blair
	Cal Woodruff
	Paul Tupper
	Scott Harrison
	Robin Barrett
	Justin O'Camb
